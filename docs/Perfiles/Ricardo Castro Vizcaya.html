            <p>My name is Ricardo Castro and I have been part of the design team throughout the whole project. During the whole process of the project I have focused on the task of both audio and the task of recording myself the different voices of the characters with the script written and adaptation with editing to the type of game we had</p>

            <p>The main task that I had assigned during all the deliveries was the task of creating to adapt and edit to our style of play all the voicelines that appear during all the levels, I recorded them myself and edited with various iterations recreating the different styles that it has each character to whom I have doubled my voice.</p>
 
            <p>Also the task of changing various voicelines and audios after the playtests and receiving feedback, with the subsequent redesign of various effects applied to the voices with the technology that we could use from home</p>
            <p>Also during all parts of the job, another task that was mainly assigned to me was to search and edit audios for all levels with different proposals to adapt to each area and the type of game we had. During all the deliveries they have been changing audios for others after the feedback from the playtests and I also took care of changing them. </p>

            <p>The main task during the alpha was to rebuild the level 1 with all the levels part of the team and I created a variety of iterations and got to fully redevelop, redesign and apply both swamp and preswamp zones in the level 1 with all the levels team getting to choose all the optimal options inside its design.
            </p>
            <p>This included the full redesign of the zone, all was done from zero to try and give it more the touch of the game that we wanted to portrait to the players playing it, apport its playstyle and not be different as it was before the rebuild of level 1 </p>

               The creation in different ways and with different proposals with iterations in machinations in ways that the player could be healed with all the design and the way that the player changed to play the game that in the end was not implemented but it was done anyway</p>

            <p>Fringilla boss design:</p>
            <p>During the boss iteration, created with Alejandro a full boss backstory and full design of abilities and gameplay of another optional boss named Fringilla, it was full created but it never got to be applied.We created this iteration to have different options at the time of creation of the boss which ended up being Ciri

            <p>The important part with which we started from the beginning of the game was the way in which we were going to transmit the narrative of the game, for this I was entrusted with the task of thinking about the most efficient way to transmit it, for what I did was a series of iterations in how different games recreated the way to transmit the main narrative to the player.</p>

            <p>after many iterations in different ways, together with the entire design team we came to the conclusion that the iteration where I recorded the voices of the characters and that the story was going to be transmitted, so that a narrator would appear, in a non-main way, but always accompanying the players was the one that we agreed with the whole team</p>

           <p>Humor:</p>
           <p>
             Together with Guillem, we were entrusted with the task of focusing on the type of humor that we wanted the game to have from start to finish and the way in which it was to be presented. To do this, we made a study of different games and gave various proposals on how to be able to approach it in a way that adapts to our style of play, for this we put together several ideas from all the iterations we carry out and we end up recreating the humorous style that the game has today, all together with help at all times from the team of design</p>
